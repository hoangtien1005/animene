## Summary
This is my first React project where I learn to apply my React skills (and some github actions, github branches, ...)

"Fun" fact: My initial intent was to use [AniAPI](https://aniapi.com) for the API source, but it is not updated fully so I had to use Anilist API with GraphQL :')

The project is not completed yet so I'll keep working on it in the near future, please feel free to contact or message me if you found any issues or bugs :)
